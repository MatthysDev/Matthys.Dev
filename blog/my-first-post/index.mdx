This is my first blog post !

How you can deploy a website faster with netlify ?

If you don't use github, what are you waiting for ?
(If you don't know how to use it, we made a video with David about how to setup it and why) :

With github you can work in team and have a backlog of all your code changes. This is a usefull widget to report bug and fix it with Github issues.

Once you can build the project, send it on Github. Now you need to go on the Netlify website to connect your Github account.
Netlify will ask if you want to deploy a repository. Select your project repo and in the deploy settings your need to sett a build command.In my case i use 'yarn build' or 'gatsby build'.

/!\ Build command is not the develop command (Yeah i try to deploy with gatsby deploy one time :( )

Once you do every step you can go on the home page of you netlify repo and trigger deploy with the button.

The first time is a bit longer because netlify need to build the website file.

Each time you update your github repo, netlify will follow and rebuild it.
